The code implements a solution for the N-Queens problem using hill climbing search.
The N-Queens problem is a classical problem in which N queens must be placed on an NÃ—N chessboard
in such a way that no two queens attacks each other. 
The hill climbing search is used to find a state where no queens are in attacking positions.
The code uses a hill climbing approach to find a solution to the N-Queens problem by iteratively 
improving the state with the minimum number of collisions. 
The program continues to generate and search for new states until a solution is found.
